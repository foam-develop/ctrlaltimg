        <p>Ctrl.Alt.Img was born out of research by photographer Çiğdem Yüksel. Çiğdem
struggled to recognise herself in the photos often used by the Dutch media to
represent Muslim women. These images seemed to share similar qualities, a
veiled woman from behind, taken at a distance, often-times with a shopping
bag in her hand. Muslim women at work, doing sports or pictured in the context
of education are rarely featured. Çiğdem asked: If new machine learning tools
are being trained on existing datasets with the same old stereotypes already
featured in the media, then how can we future-proof AI images to be more
inclusive?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Many of the current images seen every day on social media and in the news
are being generated by algorithms and image-generation apps like Dall-E,
Midjourney or Stable Diffusion. This development has an enormous influence
on visual culture and our collective consciousness. But for underrepresented
groups, this AI leap into the future can further deepen the digital and social
divide. Ctrl.Alt.Img is a creative intervention that responds to this technological
moment, using existing text-to-image tools to playfully explore more inclusive
approaches to image making.</p>
